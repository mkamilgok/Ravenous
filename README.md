# Ravenous

Ravenous is Yelp-like clone website. This is a front-end web application implemented with React. Yelp API is used in order to fetch data. 

By implementhing this project, I practiced:
- Creating Static Components in React
- Passing Information to Components in React
- Setting the State of Components in React
- Interacting with the Yelp API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Here is the screenshot of the input fields of the app:
